# Goal of the Data:

Help analyze and predict flight prices in Bangladesh based on various factors.

## Descripton of Dataset

The "Bangladesh Flight Fare Dataset" is a synthetic dataset comprising 57,000 flight records tailored to represent air travel scenarios originating from Bangladesh. This dataset simulates realistic flight fare dynamics, capturing key factors such as airline operations, airport specifics, travel classes, booking behaviors, and seasonal variations specific to Bangladeshâ€™s aviation market. It is designed for researchers, data scientists, and analysts interested in flight fare prediction, travel pattern analysis, or machine learning/deep learning applications. By combining real-world inspired statistical distributions and aviation industry standards, this dataset provides a robust foundation for exploring flight economics in a South Asian context.

## About the Data:
Useful for studying price variations, booking timing effects, class-based differences, and building predictive models for flight fares.
